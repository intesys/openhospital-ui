# Redux Structure
Here goes the description of the redux `store` when it comes to its elements. Also, the list of `actions` which the application will use to change or get the values stored through redux. It's important to analyse the api docs for a better understanding of the functioning of actions that will perform async requests (:full_moon_with_face:Redux war veterans say "you don't say!").
